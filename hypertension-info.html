        <h3>What is Hypertension?</h3>
        <p>
          Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in
          which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high.
          Usually, hypertension is defined as blood pressure above 140/90, and
          is considered severe if the pressure is above 180/120.

            <p>
              Many people have high blood pressure without experiencing any
