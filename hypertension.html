        <h3>What is Hypertension?</h3>
        <p>
          Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a condition in
          which the force of the blood against the artery walls is too high.
          Usually, hypertension is defined as blood pressure above 140/90, and
          is considered severe if the pressure is above 180/120.

            <p>
              Many people have high blood pressure without experiencing any
              symptoms, which is why it's often called the "silent killer."

              Once you start taking blood pressure medication, you can stop if
              your pressure goes down.
