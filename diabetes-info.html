        <h3>What is Diabetes?</h3>
        <p>
          Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by elevated
          levels of blood glucose (blood sugar), which leads over time to
          serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves.
          Several mechanisms contribute to hyperglycemia, but most common is
          impaired insulin production, ineffective action of insulin, or both.

        <p>
          If you are diagnosed with diabetes, it's crucial to follow your
          healthcare provider's recommendations. This may include adhering to a
          meal plan, monitoring blood sugar levels regularly, taking prescribed
          medications (oral medications or insulin), and engaging in regular
          exercise.

              other factors.
